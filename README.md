# *NLP-Assignments*

*The repository contains a collection of NLP assignments I completed for the course "Cloudy ML." These assignments cover a range of difficulty levels, starting from beginner-level tasks to intermediate-level challenges. The assignments are focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), a field that involves the analysis, understanding, and generation of human language using machine learning and computational linguistics techniques.*

*Throughout the repository, various NLP topics covered, such as text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, text classification, named entity recognition, language modeling, and more. Each assignment is designed to provide with hands-on experience and a practical understanding of NLP concepts and techniques.*

*By working through these assignments, I gained valuable insights into NLP algorithms, methodologies, and tools. I learned to apply machine learning models & NLP libraries effectively to solve real-world language processing problems and allowing me to gradually build my expertise in NLP.*
